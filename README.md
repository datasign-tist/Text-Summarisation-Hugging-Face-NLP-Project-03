# Text-Summarisation Project - 03

This will be an END-TO-END Deep learning project accessing all steps including research, Oops-Programming, NLP, Code, Deployments and Monitoring.

But WHY? Why if "ChatGPT" can easily summarize my text? My goal is to learn together to create these pipelines and architecture to understand the mathematics and core functions, it's a process-oriented approach used in industries rather than result-based.

Prerequisite for our Project:

1. 🔍 **Exploring the Landscape:**
With a solid foundation in Python programming and basic NLP knowledge, we're primed to take on the challenge of text summarization. 

2. 🛠️ **Tools of the Trade:**
Harnessing the transformative capabilities of the Hugging Face library, we'll leverage the power of pre-trained transformer models to tackle our text summarization task with finesse. 

3. 👩‍💻 **Collaboration in Action:**
But wait, we're not venturing alone on this journey! We'll harness the collaborative power of GitHub, working seamlessly with fellow enthusiasts and experts alike to share insights, exchange ideas, and co-create a masterpiece of text summarization prowess. 

4. 🌐 **Unleashing the Potential:**
But our adventure doesn't end there! With AWS at our fingertips, we'll transform our model into a user-friendly API, empowering users worldwide to experience the magic of text summarization with just a few clicks.
